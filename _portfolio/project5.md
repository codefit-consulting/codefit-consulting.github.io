**In this project we developed a series of Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards
for SwimTrek's management team, using data already available in their website's
database.**

When your website is the primary tool used to operate your business, chances are
its database contains a wealth of insights just waiting to be discovered. This
was certainly the case for SwimTrek and, in this project, they asked us to help
extract those insights into a family of dashboards that senior management and
department heads could use to better understand the state of the business.

In close collaboration with SwimTrek's management team we first mocked up the
desired dashboards (over 20 in total), designing the charts and the methodology
we would use to generate them, given the available data. We then reviewed
available BI tools, finally settling on **Tableau** owing to its rich
feature set and ease of use.

The records in a website's database are typically split across many tables (for
good reason) but this format isn't well suited to analytics. We therefore built
an analytics engine that consolidates the website's data into a more
human-friendly format once every hour, pre-computing any calculations that would
be impossible or inefficient to perform within Tableau. We then built the
dashboards using this data source, implementing the remaining calculations using
Tableau's (spreadsheet-like) functions.

The resultant dashboards have transformed the way management run the business,
with key analyses that previously took days to compile by hand, now available
24/7 in a graphical, interactive and easy to understand format. The countless
new analyses added by this project also gave SwimTrek new insights into their
customers and their purchasing behaviour, stimulating new ideas on how to grow
the business.
