**A custom e-commerce platform, tailored to your business, can incorporate many
innovative features that give you an edge over the competition. In this project
we built a custom platform for SwimTrek, an adventure travel company with
innovation at its heart.**

In 2015 when SwimTrek contracted us to replace their website, they were already
the world's leading provider of open-water swimming holidays, with a thriving
business and a loyal following of returning customers. However, they had
outgrown the capabilities of the off-the-shelf travel software they were using,
with staff having to use time-consuming, offline workarounds (often spreadsheet
based) to implement many of the novel business functions that had won SwimTrek
it's market-leading position.

We engaged in a comprehensive review process with senior staff, determining what
customer-facing and backend features the new site would need in order to
automate SwimTrek's most important business functions, including: 

- **social features** for participants travelling on the same departure (guide
  and guest profiles, group discussions, private messaging, shared photo
  gallery, etc.)
- **an invite system** that enables a booking's lead customer to invite their
  other guests to sign up, enter their own social, travel and contact details,
  and participate in the trip's social features
- **a booking system** that can automatically manage room inventory, offering
  solo-travellers single supplements, or automatic roommate matching, or
  allowing additional non-swimming guests, only if remaining room inventory can
  support it
- **a self-serve checkout** that doubles up as an edit interface, allowing
  customers to update or cancel their own booking, with a card refund (or an
  account credit) issued automatically based on their trip's refund policy
- **staggered payments**, with automatic reminder emails
- **a loyalty point system**: "SwimTrek Miles"
- **a fully-featured CRM system** allowing staff to control the content of
  customer-facing pages
- **a media asset library** with image/video upload, editing and optimisation
- **a comprehensive admin system** allowing staff to manage packages,
  departures, bookings, payments, etc.
- and much more...

The main application is built using **Ruby on Rails**, backed by a **Postgres**
database. We built it over the course of eight months, with regular face-to-face
meetings with SwimTrek in order to review progress and plan the next phase of
the build. The platform we built is now the main tool that SwimTrek staff use to
operate the business, and we have continued to engage with SwimTrek over the
years, adding new features and additional automation as their business continues
to grow.
